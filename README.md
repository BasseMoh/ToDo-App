# ToDo-App

This Android project is programmed using Java and follows the course roadmap. It consists of a splash screen, a main activity page, and a SQLite database. The main activity page displays a list of tasks that the user has added, which are stored in the SQLite database. The user can also edit and remove tasks from the list.

The project is designed to be easy to set up and use, and the code has been thoroughly commented to make it easier to understand. Additionally, all of the classes and methods are written in a way that makes them easy to maintain and update.
